I'm a statistics PhD student at Imperial College London supervised by [Seth Flaxman](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/seth.flaxman/) (Oxford, CS) and [Jeff Eaton](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton) (Imperial, DIDE), interested in methods and applications of Bayesian statistics in health and social sciences. I am mostly working on:

* [`areal-comparison`](https://github.com/athowes/areal-comparison): Understanding models for spatial structure in small-area estimation
* [`multi-agyw`](https://github.com/athowes/multi-agyw): Estimating HIV risk group proportions using a multinomial spatio-temporal model
* [`elgm-inf`](https://github.com/athowes/elgm-inf): Improving approximate Bayesian inference methods for extended latent Gaussian models
* [`exp-growth`](https://github.com/athowes/exp-growth): Time-series methods for disease-agnostic metagenomic environmental surveillance

I'm always looking to improve at writing {clear, concise, efficient, reproducible} code, so if have have any suggestions please let me know: always happy to learn!
I'm mostly a user of `orderly` for reproducible research, {`rstan`, `R-INLA`, `TMB`, `aghq`} for (somewhat) Bayesian inference, `dplyr` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` for plotting and `sf` for spatial data.

You might be interested in a list of [resources](https://github.com/athowes/resources) I've found useful during my PhD.
