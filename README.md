Hi!
I'm Adam, a Bayesian statistician primarily working with the [Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) at the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/index.htm).
Previously, I completed my PhD in [statistics and machine learning](https://statml.io/) at Imperial College London.
For more information, and my blog, see [athowes.github.io](https://athowes.github.io/).
To give an idea about my work, see:

* I'm always looking to improve at writing clear, concise, efficient, reproducible code.
Any suggestions, let me know!
I predominantly program in R.
Over time, I'd like to become multilinual by [learning Python](https://github.com/athowes/tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file#learning-python-as-an-r-user) (and maybe Julia?): advice welcome.
* I'm currently reading: [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/), see [`reading`](https://github.com/athowes/reading).
* You may be interested in these [`resources`](https://github.com/athowes/resources) I've found useful, or what I'm learning about via [`tutorial`](https://github.com/athowes/tutorial).
