I'm a statistics PhD student at Imperial College London supervised by [Seth Flaxman](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/seth.flaxman/) (Oxford, CS) and [Jeff Eaton](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/people/jeff-eaton/) (Harvard, CCDD), interested in methods and applications of Bayesian statistics in health and social sciences.
I am mostly working on:

* [`areal-comparison`](https://github.com/athowes/areal-comparison): Understanding models for spatial structure in small-area estimation
* [`multi-agyw`](https://github.com/athowes/multi-agyw): Estimating HIV risk group proportions using a multinomial spatio-temporal model
* [`elgm-inf`](https://github.com/athowes/elgm-inf): Improving approximate Bayesian inference methods for extended latent Gaussian models
* [`exp-growth`](https://github.com/athowes/exp-growth): Time-series methods for disease-agnostic metagenomic environmental surveillance

I'm always looking to improve at writing clear, concise, efficient, reproducible code.
If have have any suggestions, let me know!
I mostly use [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) for reproducible research; [`rstan`](https://mc-stan.org/), [`R-INLA`](https://www.r-inla.org/), [`TMB`](https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/Introduction.html), and [`aghq`](https://github.com/awstringer1/aghq) for (somewhat) Bayesian inference; [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for data manipulation; [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for plotting; and [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for spatial data.

You may be interested in these [resources](https://github.com/athowes/resources) I've found useful.
