### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a visiting student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), and PhD student in statistics at Imperial College London supervised by [Jeff Eaton](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton) (Imperial, DIDE) and [Seth Flaxman](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/seth.flaxman/) (Oxford, CS), interested in applying Bayesian statistics to health and social sciences, particularly global health and biosecurity. During my PhD I have mostly worked on:

* [`areal-comparison`](https://github.com/athowes/areal-comparison): Understanding models for spatial structure in small-area estimation
* [`multi-agyw`](https://github.com/athowes/multi-agyw): Estimating HIV risk group proportions using a multinomial spatio-temporal model
* [`elgm-inf`](https://github.com/athowes/elgm-inf): Improving approximate Bayesian inference methods for extended latent Gaussian models
* [`exp-growth`](https://github.com/athowes/exp-growth): Methods for disease-agnostic metagenomic environmental surveillance

I'd like to improve at writing {clear, concise, efficient, reproducible} code, so if you see anything on this profile which I could improve upon please let me know: always happy to learn!
I'm mostly a user of `orderly` for reproducible research, {`rstan`, `R-INLA`, `TMB`, `aghq`} for inference, `dplyr` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` for plotting and `sf` for spatial data.
