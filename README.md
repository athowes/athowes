Hi!
I'm Adam, a Bayesian statistician (and nascent data scientist).

* Currently I work with the [Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) at the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/index.htm).
* Previously I completed [my PhD](https://github.com/athowes/thesis) in [statistics and machine learning](https://statml.io/) at Imperial College London.
* You may be interested in these [`resources`](https://github.com/athowes/resources) I've found useful, what I'm learning about via [`tutorial`](https://github.com/athowes/tutorial) or [`reading`](https://github.com/athowes/reading) (currently: [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/))
* You can learn more about me at my [website](https://athowes.github.io/).
