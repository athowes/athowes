I'm a statistics PhD student (defending March 2024) at Imperial, supervised by [Seth Flaxman](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/seth.flaxman/) (Oxford, CS) and [Jeff Eaton](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/people/jeff-eaton/) (Imperial, DIDE; Harvard, CCDD).
I'm interested in methods and real world applications of Bayesian statistics, typically in health and social sciences.
For example:

| Repository | Description |
|:---|:----|
| [`thesis`](https://github.com/athowes/thesis) | My thesis, "Bayesian spatio-temporal methods for small-area estimation of HIV indicators" |
| [`beyond-borders`](https://github.com/athowes/beyond-borders) |Evaluating the suitability of spatial adjacency for small-area estimation ([`arealutils`](https://github.com/athowes/arealutils))
| [`multi-agyw`](https://github.com/athowes/multi-agyw) |Estimating HIV risk group proportions using a multinomial spatio-temporal model ([`multi.utils`](https://github.com/athowes/multi.utils), [UNAIDS](https://hivtools.unaids.org/pse/](https://hivtools.unaids.org/shipp/)))
| [`naomi-aghq`](https://github.com/athowes/naomi-aghq) |Improving approximate Bayesian inference methods for extended latent Gaussian models ([`inf.utils`](https://github.com/athowes/inf.utils))
| [`exp-growth`](https://github.com/athowes/exp-growth) | Time-series methods for disease-agnostic metagenomic environmental threat detection

I'm always looking to improve at writing clear, concise, efficient, reproducible code.
If have have any suggestions, let me know!
I predominantly program in R, and use [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) for reproducible research; [`rstan`](https://mc-stan.org/), [`R-INLA`](https://www.r-inla.org/), [`TMB`](https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/Introduction.html), and [`aghq`](https://github.com/awstringer1/aghq) for (somewhat) Bayesian inference; the [`tidyverse`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for data manipulation; [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for plotting; and [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for spatial data.
Over time, I am looking to become multilinual by [learning Python](https://github.com/athowes/tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file#learning-python-as-an-r-user): any advice welcome.

I'm currently reading: [Trees, maps, and theorems](https://www.principiae.be/X0100.php), [The Effective Manager](https://www.manager-tools.com/products/effective-manager-book-second-edition)

You may be interested in these [`resources`](https://github.com/athowes/resources) I've found useful, or what I'm learning about via [`tutorial`](https://github.com/athowes/tutorial).
