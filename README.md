### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a visiting researcher at the [Nucleic Acid Observatory](https://www.naobservatory.org/), MIT Media Lab, and PhD student in statistics at Imperial supervised by [Jeff Eaton](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton) (Imperial, DIDE) and [Seth Flaxman](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/seth.flaxman/) (Oxford, CS) interested in applying Bayesian statistics to health and social sciences, particularly global health and biosecurity.

I'd like to improve at writing {clear, concise, efficient, reproducible} code, so if you see anything on this profile which I could improve upon please let me know: always happy to learn!
I'm mostly a user of `orderly` for reproducible research, {`rstan`, `R-INLA`, `TMB`} for inference, `dplyr` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` for plotting and `sf` for spatial data.
When I have a chance, I'd like to learn `dt` for faster data manipulation, as well as perhaps a secondary programming language (e.g. Python, Julia).
